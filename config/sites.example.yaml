#   - scraper_type: "static" for simple HTML, "playwright" for JS-rendered
#   - selectors: CSS selectors to extract data

#   - click_each: Click through elements to reveal more content (playwright only)

#       - wait_after: Milliseconds to wait after each click (default: 2000)

sites:
  # Example: Jonah Digital Floor Plans (JS-rendered, requires Playwright)
  # Many apartment sites use this framework - look for .jd-fp-* classes
  - name: "Rent @ US"
    url: "https://liveherepls.com/floorplans/"
    scraper_type: "playwright"
    selectors:
      listing_container: ".jd-fp-unit-card"
      title: ".jd-fp-card-info__title--large"
      price: "[data-jd-fp-adp='display']"
      # Note: beds/baths/sqft are combined in one element as "1 bed 1 bath 803 sq. ft."
      # The scraper parses this combined text automatically
      details: "p.jd-fp-card-info__text"
      availability: ".jd-fp-card-info__text--brand"
      floorplan: ".jd-fp-unit-card__floorplan-title"
      url: "a"
    wait_for: ".jd-fp-unit-card"

  # Example: Interactive map-based floor plan viewer
  # Some sites show different units when you click on different floors
  # Use click_each to click through all floor elements and aggregate results
  - name: "Rent @ US"
    url: "https://liveherecomplexwebsite.com/floorplans/"
    scraper_type: "playwright"
    selectors:
      listing_container: ".jd-fp-unit-card"
      title: ".jd-fp-card-info__title--large"
      price: "[data-jd-fp-adp='display']"
      details: "p.jd-fp-card-info__text"
      availability: ".jd-fp-card-info__text--brand"
      url: "a"
    wait_for: ".jd-fp-unit-card"
    # Click through each floor to reveal all available units
    click_each:
      selector: ".jd-fp-map-embed__floors-item--has-avail"
      wait_after: 2000

  # Example: Static HTML site (simpler, faster)
  - name: "Example Rentals"
    url: "https://example.com/apartments"
    scraper_type: "static"
    selectors:
      listing_container: ".listing-card"
      title: "h2.title"
      price: ".price"
      bedrooms: ".beds"
      bathrooms: ".baths"
      sqft: ".sqft"
      availability: ".status"
      url: "a.details-link"

# Tips for finding selectors:
# 1. Open the site in Chrome
# 2. Right-click on an element and select "Inspect"
# 3. Look for unique class names or IDs
# 4. Test selectors in DevTools Console: document.querySelectorAll('.your-selector')

# Example sites configuration
# Copy this to config/sites.yaml and customize for your needs
#
# Each site requires:
#   - name: Friendly name for the site
#   - url: URL to scrape
#   - scraper_type: "static" for simple HTML, "playwright" for JS-rendered
#   - selectors: CSS selectors to extract data
#
# Optional:
#   - wait_for: CSS selector to wait for before scraping (playwright only)

sites:
  # Example: JS-rendered apartment site (requires Playwright)
  - name: "Rent @ US"
    url: "https://liveherepls.com/floorplans/"
    scraper_type: "playwright"
    selectors:
      listing_container: ".floor-plan-card"
      title: ".fp-title"
      price: ".fp-price"
      bedrooms: ".fp-beds"
      sqft: ".fp-sqft"
      url: "a"
    wait_for: ".jd-fp"

  # Example: Static HTML site (simpler, faster)
  - name: "Example Rentals"
    url: "https://example.com/apartments"
    scraper_type: "static"
    selectors:
      listing_container: ".listing-card"
      title: "h2.title"
      price: ".price"
      bedrooms: ".beds"
      bathrooms: ".baths"
      sqft: ".sqft"
      availability: ".status"
      url: "a.details-link"

# Tips for finding selectors:
# 1. Open the site in Chrome
# 2. Right-click on an element and select "Inspect"
# 3. Look for unique class names or IDs
# 4. Test selectors in DevTools Console: document.querySelectorAll('.your-selector')
